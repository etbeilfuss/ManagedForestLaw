# ManagedForestLaw
This program assists in the calculation of Managed Forest Law (MFL) acreages for the MFL Program in Wisconsin.

This program consists of an R script and was built using RStudio version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31 ucrt). This program requires R to run. R can be downloaded here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

This programs intended use is for Certified Plan Writers to help quickly calculate how many acres they are able to enroll into an MFL Plan based on the inputs of Total Acreage and Productive Acreage.

If the as-is acreage for productive forest is less than 80% of the total acreage, the program will return the maximum acreage that you can enroll into the program.
